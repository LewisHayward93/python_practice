# tuples are immutable lists #
dimensions = (200, 5)
print(dimensions[0])

# tuple with single element requires trainling comma
single = (1,)

# loop through tuple same as list #
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)

# it is possible to change values in tuple but requires rewriting the entire tuple
